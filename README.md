## General Information
Background: The lending industry faces significant challenges in managing loan defaults. Understanding the factors that contribute to loan defaults can help lenders mitigate risks and improve their lending strategies.

Business Problem: The project aims to identify the key risk factors associated with loan defaults (charged-off loans) and provide insights to minimize defaults.

Dataset: The dataset used in this project includes information on loan amounts, annual income, interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, employment length, loan grades, home ownership status, and loan status (charged-off or fully paid).

## Conclusions
The analysis of charged-off cases reveals several key risk factors associated with loan defaults. Borrowers with higher loan amounts, lower annual incomes, higher interest rates, and higher debt-to-income ratios are more likely to default. Additionally, even borrowers with longer employment lengths and lower loan grades are at risk. These insights can help lenders identify high-risk borrowers and implement strategies to mitigate default risks, such as offering financial counseling, adjusting loan terms, or implementing stricter lending criteria.
